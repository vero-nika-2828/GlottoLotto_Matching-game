# Design

## Design choices

The site will be visited by students of English language. The students are expected to have diverse level of knowledge of English language and to belong to different age groups. The website should appealing to adults as well as children and in order to encourage users to keep practicing the language and enjoy it, rather than see it as an obligation, design elements should aid with evoking friendliness, positivity, playfullness and confidence.



## Colour scheme

The main colors of the website are dark green, gold yellow, pink and white. 
* Dark green (#00483E) is used as a background color for all the containers: Main menu, Card area and Resull to provide a contrast for the text and to evoke a positive and relaxed feelings.

* Gold yellow (#D79E06) color was used for all the text apart from the button text to complement the dark green background and give the page a happy joyful feel. 

* Pink color (#CF9EAC) was used as the button color. This color diverges slightly from the background and description colors and was chosen with aim to bring the users attention to the navigation menu. It is also asociate with plaufulness which is the mood we want to set before the game.

* White color (#FFFFFF) was used as a button text for the contrast. 

* Brighter shades of pink (#FABEB4, #FCA99B) and ligher shade of (#00C9AC) were used to create linear gradient on the back of the card.

* Dark purple (#800080) and dark blue (#0000FF) used for the linear gradient for on the front of the cards to make the pictures and text stand out.

* Gray (#E9EEF1) and is used for the screen background.

## Bugs

### Solved bugs 
 |  Expected |  Bug |  Fix |
 |  :---| :---|  :---|
 |  Hero image should be directly under the header | Header went over the hero image | Height property in navigation bar was updated  to 100% and that pushed the image lower |
 |The website should fit the width of a respective viewport | The scroll bar appeared at the bottom so it was necessary to move right and left to view the whole content. This was due to 'About section' was going over the set viewport width | Margin of  'About section'  was set to 0
 |Footer should cover the whole bottom of the page | There was a white space under the footer which was cause by the content of reviewer-boxes in 'Review section' overflowing | The height of the review-background was adjusted to give the text more space. The review-container was adjusted as well to fit the section without excessive free space |
 | Hamburger menu items should be centred | The menu items were all starting from the same level on the left which made portfolio to stick out | The parent navigation menu list was given display property with value block. The children a elements were given property display with value flex and justify content property with value centre which aligned the links into the middle of the screen |
 | When users of smaller screen touch the options from Hamburger navigation menu it should change the color of the whole screen from left to right | There was a space on the left when the color changed due to the ul element in header section had padding applied | Padding left property for ul element was removed |
 |  Two review boxes should get smaller when the viewport gets smaller and text should align accordingly | For the viewports under 411 px header and star rating were getting  distorted and the letters as well as stars were getting under each other and lost original alignment | Parent container was of the header and start rating was updated to block and  header and star rating were given display property with  value flex which pushed these two elements  under the picture |
 | The checkbox for the photo type selection should get stacked under each other on the devices which are narrower than 800px | The checkboxes inputs and the labels were not aligned neither vertically or horizontally |  The checkbox inputs were wrapped into the unordered list and displayed as a block
