## Bugs

### Solved bugs 
 |  Expected |  Bug |  Fix |
 |  :---| :---|  :---|
 | Return buttons should take me to the main menu | Return button in 'How to play' or 'Play' section did not react and didn't take me back to the main menu|return function was moved inside the on click for #btn-instructions and  #btn-play function and that applied the return function als when those modals are open |
 | The user should see only the content for the chosen element when then open any of the navigation options : How to play, Play and Score board and the previvous content should not be seen  | When the How to play or play button was clicked it added the content of the modal to the main menu content and when clicked back to main content it added the content of the How to play to the bottom. The same happened in Play modal | The function to clear the existing text before adding new one was added 
 | The timer should always show one digit for minutes and two digits for seconds | When seconds went under 10 only one digit was displayed | The timeDecrease function was adjusted to add 0 to each digit when there is only one digit represingting seconds which usually happens when they are lower than  10 |
 |Music should play as soon as the user clicks on the speaker | The music took about  15 seconds to start playing | Thes size of the audio was trimmed and the loop was applied
 | When the user clicks on the area where the matched cards used be it should not react| The animal sound was played when clicked on the aread where matched pictures used to be and when clicked on two matching the sound was played |  Added condition to apply the cardTurns function only to those cards which dont have matched class
 | When match is found the cards fade out | The outline of the cards stayed visible  | Styling added to the card class (.card) to set the border to none |
 | When users clicks on the card and it flips only the front of the card should be visible| When card was fliped to the front of the card the white outline was visible in the background  | style propety was added to remove the visibility of the front card when it flips|
 |It is not possible for the user to submit their score if the input field is empty | The text got submitted even when the user didn't enter their name | The 'save to scoreboard' button was disabled and an even listener was added to remove the disabled attribute when the key is up
